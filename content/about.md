[Accessible Minimalism](https://github.com/leonstafford/accessible-minimalism-hugo-theme)
 is a minimalist [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme with a penchant for
 accessibility.

It solves the problem of the bloated, inaccessible web by focusing on
 accessibility and content over visual styling.

## For 

Producing an accessible website is barely an achievement if
 blind/visually-impaired users can't produce the content and develop the site
 themselves. Towards this, the Accessible Minimalism theme requires minimal
 [configuration](https://github.com/leonstafford/accessible-minimalism-hugo-theme#configuration)
 to get started and generate a complete website.

## Why Hugo?

Choosing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as our target Static Site Generator is also
 an accessibility choice, with its single-binary executable quickly installable
 on all common operating systems. Its use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
 allows for easy editing of site content in the user's preferred editor.
